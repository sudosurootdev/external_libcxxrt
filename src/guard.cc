/**
 * guard.cc: Functions for thread-safe static initialisation.
 *
 * Static values in C++ can be initialised lazily their first use.  This file
 * contains functions that are used to ensure that two threads attempting to
 * initialize the same static do not call the constructor twice.  This is
 * important because constructors can have side effects, so calling the
 * constructor twice may be very bad.
 *
 * Statics that require initialisation are protected by a 64-bit value.  Any
 * platform that can do 32-bit atomic test and set operations can use this
 * value as a low-overhead lock.  Because statics (in most sane code) are
 * accessed far more times than they are initialised, this lock implementation
 * is heavily optimised towards the case where the static has already been
 * initialised.
